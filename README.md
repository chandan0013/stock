# Basic Stock Ticker Web App

This was part of The Data Incubator's onboarding pre-prep project. The goal here was to demonstrate some hands-on experience with Git, Flask, JSON, Pandas, Requests, Heroku, and Bokeh for visualization. It fetches stock prices using Quandl's API. (This provides data up through March 2018.)

The Heroku-hosted app can be found [here](https://twelve-day-milestone.herokuapp.com/). Note that this was built on their free service, and is kept asleep by default, so it may take about 10s to wake up.
