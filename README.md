# Stock Ticker 

This repository contains my Milestone Project for TDI 12Day Program.
This project deals with the basic concepts of Git, Flask, JSON, Pandas, Requests, Heroku, and Bokeh for visualization. 
The repository contains a basic template for a Flask configuration that will work on Heroku.

This code requests the stock data from the [Quandl WIKI dataset](https://www.quandl.com/databases/WIKIP/documentation). The app takes ticker, year, and various price metrics as inputs and outputs a time-series plot. The app is available [here].
